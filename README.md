# UV-Temperature-field-data-logger
A UV and temperature data logger design and code using SparkFun VEML6075 UV and Adafruit MCP9808 breakout sensors.

This project documents information on the development of a prototyped battery-powered UV and temperature data logger for UV and temperature sensing in remote aquatic environments. 

The logger consists of an MCU and data logger shield which interfaces with 4x temperature and 4x UV sensor digital breakouts via a MUX. The logger is powered by 2x 4.5V AA battery packs connected via a low power circuit which is manually controlled by an adjustable trimpot to turn off roughly every 5 minutes. There is also a manual OFF/ON switch. 

The logger is currently being quoted to have the system replicated parts supplied onto a circuit board and put in waterproof housing with 4x long arms up to 1 metre attaching sensors contained in their own waterproof housing with UV transparent 0.1mm teflon diffusor above a 4.5mm x 4.5mm window situated above the UV sensor.
